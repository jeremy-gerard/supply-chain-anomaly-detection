# Supply Chain Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection from categorical data proof-of-concept.

Demonstrates a solution for predicting country of origin from shipping records.

This is a use case encountered often since tariffs are usually declared based on the country goods come from, thus if someone wants to avoid tariffs or restrictions they might declare another country, if one can predict with decent accuracy the country of origin it is then possible to flag shipments with unlikely origins.

## Usage

```bash run.sh```
